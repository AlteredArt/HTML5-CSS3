//given a html doc representing a test consisting of multiple choice questions
//each question has several possible choices and only some are correct
//each ? is answered correctly if and only if all the correct choices and none of the inccorrect ones are checked
//your task is to determine the users score, the number of ?s answered correctly
// call the function should_be_checked(question_ index, choice_index)
/which determines wether a specific choice should be checked true or false
//the form is created using form, feildset, legend, and input tags
//each feildset represent one question and has a id attribute of the form "question-<question_index>"
    // it also has several children: a non empty legend and one or more imputs
    //each input represents a single choice for it's parent question.
    //each input has a type attribute set to the checkbox and an id attribute of the form "choice-<question_index>
        <choice_index>"
            //for example the third choice in the second ? has an id attribute set to choice-2-3
            //you can assume that for every input the question index that appears in its id is the same as that of its
            parent fieldset

            //write a function solution given access to a dom tree representing an html doc and access to the should be
            checked function
            //returns an integer representing the number of correctly answered questions
